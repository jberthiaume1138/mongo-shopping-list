The Zombie Readiness Reminder is a Node.js / Express / MongoDB application to help you prepare for the coming zombie apocalypse.

Built on Node.js, data for each task is stored in a MongoDB database. An Express API exposes this data with the Mongoose library and the front end is built using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery with Handlebars.js providing the templates on the client side.

The application is fully responsive and works great on a mobile device.

It is deployed on Heroku at https://frozen-beach-26945.herokuapp.com/, with continuous integration via Travis CI and a full set of tests through the Mocha test runner and Chai assertion library.

Brainzzzzz!
